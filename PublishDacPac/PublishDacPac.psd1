Publish-DacPac allows you to deploy a SQL Server Database DacPac to a SQL Server instance using a DAC Publish Profile.  The target can be a on-premise SQL Server instance, an Azure SQL Managed Instance or an Azure SQL Database.

# What's New

This release provides support for deployment to an Azure SQL Managed Instance or an Azure SQL Database.  Such deployments require a username/password combination to connect to the Azure SQL service.  Simply select *SQL Server or Azure SQL Authentication* in the **Authentication Method** dropdown and enter your Azure username and password.  Remember to use a secured variable for your password!

Encrypted connections for database deployment are now supported.

Publish-DacPac simplifies the use of SqlPackage.exe to deploy a DACPAC by using a DAC Publish Profile which provides for fine-grained control over the database creation and upgrades, including upgrades for schema, triggers, stored procedures, roles, users, extended properties etc. Using a DAC Publish Profile, multiple different properties can be set to ensure that the database is created or upgraded properly.

Publish-DacPac compares the content of a DACPAC to the database already on the target server and generates a deployment script. You can tailor how publish works using a DAC Publish Profile.

Publish-DacPac can be used to automate the deployment of databases, either as part of a build in Azure DevOps, or part of a server deployment using Octopus Deploy or Azure DevOps Release Manager.

To automate build and deployment of databases in Azure DevOps, you can use VsBuild to create DACPAC from your Visual Studio solution. You can then add a PowerShell task which uses Publish-DacPac to invoke SQLPackage.exe to deploy each DACPAC using your own custom DAC Publish Profile.
